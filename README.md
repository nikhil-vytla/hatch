# hatch 🥚

Little agent-driven vibe-coded experiments. Inspired by simonw's [very fun blog on async code research (Nov 2025)](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Nov/6/async-code-research/).

For these experiments, all I hope is that I get to learn something new! I have a feeling I'd also love to eventually graduate some of these, perhaps to more polished [agent skills](https://www.claude.com/blog/skills), custom tools/[MCP servers](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started/intro), or (slightly) more formal research!
